XSD Modification
===
In this assignment, students will clone a repository containing an XSD file that describes a Book object. The student will then import that XSD as a JAXB class. Once that is done, the student will design a Library JAXB class that contains a collection of books, along with an LibraryName tag, an Address, and a collection of Librarian JAXB objects which will be defined with Name, Age, and Salary fields. The student will then use JAXB to generate an XML document that matches the example document provided. Once the student confirms their XML document matches the provided example, the student will then generate a new XSD and submit their assignment.
